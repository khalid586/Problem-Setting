>**Previously I had experience of solving problems on various online judges and participating in online & onsite coding competitions.** <br><br>
**In 2023 we had an Intra University programming competition organized by our computer club. Our faculty proposed the students having onsite coding competition experience should set a few problems in this contest.**  <br><br>
**I had the opportunity to set 2 problems in the contest and experience the problem setting process.**<br><br>
